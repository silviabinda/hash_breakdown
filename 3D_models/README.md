# Info on 3D models

In the folder "3D_models", you can file .stl files of all the 3D printed parts that are included in the Hash Breakdown artwork.

First, print the base modules in the folder "base". Altoghether, in the final set up, there are 17 basic modules, 5 of which represent the OR logic gate and 12 representing the AND logic gate.

In the "holders" folder, you will find different types of holders for components such as ESP32, amplifier, oled display.

Finally, in the "wall_mount" folder there is the piece that serves to mount the module on the wall, print 1 piece for each module, in this case that would be 17 piecies.
