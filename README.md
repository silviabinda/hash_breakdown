## About
The artwork “Hash Breakdown" is an autonomous system constituted by an electronic and digital ensamble of microcomputers, modules, 3D prints, sensors and codes with real-time functionality. This critical interface parses sentences related to the keywords “feminism is” from the world wide web and then starts a slowed-down explanatory process of converting the parsed sentence into a hash, using the SHA-256 algorithm. What normally takes less than a millisecond, is here extended into a 4-minute explanatory cycle, represented visually within a structure imitating a simplified logic gates diagram of the very same SHA-256 hashing function.
